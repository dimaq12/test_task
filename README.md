There are two ways to run the app:<br/>
If you have docker and docker compose installed on your machine just run ```docker-compose up``` in the terminal.<br/>
If you don't have docker  run ```npm i``` in each folder and then run ```npm run start``` script<br/>
Was built on 16.13.1 node version <br/>
Good luck
